### Yunzhi (Ariel) Zheng | 郑蕴之

Doctoral Candidate, Marriage and Family Therapy  
Department of Human Development and Family Science  
Florida State University  

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Marriage and Family Therapy at Florida State University. My research examines how couples navigate difficult times together, especially the role of mindfulness in couple relationships. I am also interested in applying innovative approaches in couple intervention research for new insights.

My work focuses on:

- **Mindfulness in couple relationships** 
- **Couples coping with external stressors** 
- **Innovative methods in couple intervention research**, including:
  - Dyadic and longitudinal models (APIM, common fate models, daily diary)
  - Measurement-based care and process-oriented research in couple therapy
  - Machine learning approaches 

I am also a practicing couple and family therapist and supervisor-in-training, and my clinical work and my research continually informs one another.
